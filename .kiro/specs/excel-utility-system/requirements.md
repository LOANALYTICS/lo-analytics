# Excel Utility System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive Excel utility system to replace the current XLSX implementation with a more robust solution that supports proper styling, centering, colors, and maintains clean, error-prone code architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Excel Library Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a reliable Excel library that supports full styling capabilities, so that I can create properly formatted Excel files with colors, borders, and alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates Excel files THEN it SHALL use the `exceljs` library instead of `xlsx`
2. WHEN Excel files are created THEN they SHALL support full styling including colors, borders, fonts, and alignment
3. WHEN the library is integrated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing Excel generation functionality
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL render correctly in Excel applications

### Requirement 2: Excel Utility Module

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized Excel utility module, so that Excel generation logic is reusable, maintainable, and follows DRY principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Excel utilities THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated utility module at `lib/utils/excel.ts`
2. WHEN the utility is used THEN it SHALL provide functions for common Excel operations (styling, formatting, data conversion)
3. WHEN Excel files are generated THEN they SHALL use the centralized utility functions
4. WHEN the utility is updated THEN all Excel generation across the app SHALL benefit from improvements
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the utility SHALL provide clear error messages and proper error handling

### Requirement 3: Assessment Report Excel Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want assessment reports to be properly formatted with colors, centering, and professional styling, so that the reports are visually appealing and easy to read.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN headers SHALL have yellow background color (#FFFF00)
2. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN all text SHALL be centered both horizontally and vertically
3. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN cells SHALL have proper borders (thin, black)
4. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN column widths SHALL be automatically adjusted for content
5. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN merged cells SHALL be properly handled for course information spanning multiple CLO rows
6. WHEN generating assessment reports THEN fonts SHALL be consistent (Arial, appropriate sizes)

### Requirement 4: Clean Code Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Excel generation code to be clean, modular, and error-resistant, so that it's easy to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing Excel utilities THEN the code SHALL follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
2. WHEN creating Excel functions THEN they SHALL be pure functions with clear inputs and outputs
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling and logging
4. WHEN organizing code THEN Excel-related functionality SHALL be separated from business logic
5. WHEN adding new Excel features THEN they SHALL be easily extensible through the utility module

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want Excel generation to be fast and reliable, so that reports are generated quickly without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating large Excel files THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without memory issues
2. WHEN Excel generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
3. WHEN multiple users generate reports simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests properly
4. WHEN Excel files are downloaded THEN they SHALL be properly formatted and openable in Excel applications
5. WHEN the system encounters data issues THEN it SHALL gracefully handle missing or invalid data
